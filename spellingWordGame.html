<h1 id="header1">The Spelling Word Game</h1>

<p id="p1">This is the SpellingWordGame, and it means business. Well, really it means education, or more literally it means that it is a game for spelling words... I'll start again. This is the SpellingWordGame, and you will have to guess what word I'm thinking of! There, got it that time. Anyway, you give me ten words, then I pick one at random. Then you have to guess what word I'm thinking of. Get it right, and you win. Get it wrong, and I start killing hostages. Kidding! I take points away. Lose all your points, <b>then</b> I kill the hostages. So, get to it!<br><br></p>
