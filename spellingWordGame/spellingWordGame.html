<h1 id="header1">The Spelling Word Game</h1>

<p id="p1">This is the SpellingWordGame, and it means business. Well, really it means education, or more literally it means that it is a game for spelling words... I will start again. This is the SpellingWordGame, and you will have to guess what word I'm thinking of! There, got it that time. Anyway, you give me ten words, then I pick one at random. Then you have to guess what word I'm thinking of. Get it right, and you win. Get it wrong, and I start killing hostages. Kidding! I take points away. Lose all your points, <b>then</b> I kill the hostages. So, get to it!<br></p>

<h2 id="header2">And so the game...</h2>
