progWiz-js
==========

JavaScript game to teach programming... with Wizards!

The goal here is to create a game that teaches the basic ideas of programming (Flow Control, methods, maybe variables) ala Guido Van Robot. However, instead of a robot picking up trash, this will be a wizard totally icing dudes (or dogs) with spells that the wizard creates. The basic attack will be provided, but it's up to the user to augment that attack by giving it intelligence via programming.

The alterior goals are to help teach me javascript, get more into game programming, and develop browser apps.
